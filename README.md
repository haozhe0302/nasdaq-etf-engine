# HQQQ — Nasdaq-100 ETF Engine

**Frontend Live Demo:** <https://delightful-dune-08a7a390f.1.azurestaticapps.net/>

Backend Live Demo: <https://app-hqqq-api-mvp-cdgffghwf8c4hgdh.eastus-01.azurewebsites.net/api/system/health>

HQQQ is a synthetic Nasdaq-100 ETF pricing engine for real-time iNAV
calculation and monitoring.

## What HQQQ computes

$$iNAV_t = \text{ScaleFactor} \times \sum_{i}(P_{i,t} \times Q_i)$$

Live constituent prices (`P`) and calibrated position sizes (`Q`)
produce a raw basket value; a continuity-preserving `ScaleFactor`
keeps the displayed iNAV stable across basket transitions.


The repository is in a **transitional architecture**:

- **Phase 1 (legacy)** — the original
  `hqqq-api` modular monolith plus the `hqqq-ui` React app.
- **Phase 2 (current service-based app tier, in-repo)** — a split into
  `hqqq-gateway`, `hqqq-ingress`, `hqqq-quote-engine`,
  `hqqq-persistence`, and `hqqq-analytics` over Kafka / Redis /
  TimescaleDB. Runnable locally via Docker Compose and deployable to
  Azure Container Apps via Bicep + GitHub OIDC. Multi-replica gateway
  fan-out is real.
- **Phase 3 (under construction)** — Kubernetes app-tier operationalization,
  HA topologies for stateful infra, multi-instance workers.

## Architecture at a glance

This diagram is the quick-read view of the current repository state:
Phase 1 and Phase 2 coexist; Phase 2 serving/compute/persistence paths
are real, while some ingestion/reference-data responsibilities remain in
the legacy monolith.

```text
External market data provider (Tiingo)
  |
  +--> Phase 1 reference path (still live for public demo)
  |      src/hqqq-api (monolith)
  |        - real Tiingo WS/REST ingestion
  |        - basket refresh + corp-action adjustment
  |        - can publish market.raw_ticks.v1 bridge events for Phase 2 consumers
  |        - legacy /api/system/health path
  |
  \--> Phase 2 service-based runtime (current app tier in repo)
         (ingestion in hqqq-ingress is still stub; monolith currently bridges ticks)

         Kafka topics
           - market.raw_ticks.v1 (key=symbol, ingress/bridge -> consumers)
           - refdata.basket.active.v1 (active basket state)
           - pricing.snapshots.v1 (quote-engine -> persistence)
                |
                +--> hqqq-quote-engine (consumer group A)
                |      - computes iNAV and quote state
                |      - writes Redis latest views:
                |          hqqq:snapshot:{basketId}
                |          hqqq:constituents:{basketId}
                |          hqqq:freshness:{basketId}
                |      - publishes live QuoteUpdateEnvelope to Redis pub/sub:
                |          hqqq:channel:quote-update
                |      - publishes pricing snapshots to Kafka:
                |          pricing.snapshots.v1
                |
                +--> hqqq-persistence (consumer group B)
                |      - writes TimescaleDB hypertables:
                |          quote_snapshots, raw_ticks
                |      - maintains 1m/5m continuous aggregates + retention
                |
                \--> hqqq-analytics (one-shot job)
                       - reads Timescale only
                       - report mode today; replay/backfill/anomaly deferred

         Redis (latest-state + fan-out trigger)
           - snapshot keys for gateway read path
           - pub/sub channel hqqq:channel:quote-update
                 |
                 v
         hqqq-gateway (REST + SignalR edge, 1..N replicas)
           - /api/quote, /api/constituents      <- Redis snapshots
           - /api/history?range=                <- TimescaleDB
           - /api/system/health                 <- native aggregator
           - /hubs/market                       <- per-replica Redis subscribe +
                                                    local SignalR broadcast
                                                    (no SignalR Redis backplane)

## What Phase 2 currently includes

Service tier (under `src/services/`):

| Service | Role today |
|---------|------------|
| `hqqq-gateway` | REST + SignalR serving edge. Reads Redis for `/api/quote` and `/api/constituents`, Timescale for `/api/history`. Native `/api/system/health` aggregator. Subscribes to `hqqq:channel:quote-update` and broadcasts `QuoteUpdate` locally per replica (no SignalR Redis backplane). |
| `hqqq-ingress` | **Stub today.** Real Tiingo ingestion still lives in the Phase 1 monolith. |
| `hqqq-quote-engine` | Consumes `market.raw_ticks.v1` + `refdata.basket.active.v1`, runs iNAV compute, writes `hqqq:snapshot:{basketId}` / `hqqq:constituents:{basketId}`, publishes `pricing.snapshots.v1`, and publishes live `QuoteUpdate` envelopes to Redis pub/sub `hqqq:channel:quote-update`. |
| `hqqq-persistence` | Consumes `pricing.snapshots.v1` + `market.raw_ticks.v1` into TimescaleDB hypertables; bootstraps `quote_snapshots_1m` / `quote_snapshots_5m` continuous aggregates and retention policies. |
| `hqqq-analytics` | One-shot Timescale report job (`Analytics:Mode=report`) — not a long-running service. Replay / backfill / anomaly detection are deferred. |
| `hqqq-reference-data` | Web service; in-memory seed basket today. Issuer feeds + corp-action pipeline still live in the Phase 1 monolith. |

Infrastructure roles:

- **Kafka** — durable event log + fan-out backbone for compute and persistence.
- **Redis** — latest-state serving cache *and* the live `/hubs/market` fan-out trigger channel.
- **TimescaleDB** — historical write side; sole source for `/api/history` and the `hqqq-analytics` report job.

Full Phase 2 architecture, data plane diagram, and the per-endpoint
gateway source-selection matrix are in
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md). Migration status and
explicitly deferred items are in

## Toolchain

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| .NET SDK | 10.0+ | `dotnet --version` |
| Node.js | 22 LTS | Pinned in `src/hqqq-ui/.nvmrc` |
| npm | 10.x | Bundled with Node 22 |
| Docker / Docker Compose | recent | Required for Phase 2 local infra and the Phase 2 app-tier overlay |

---


## Known limitations

1. **Hybrid basket, not official full-holdings reconstruction.**
   Basket composition comes from public scraped sources (Stock
   Analysis, Schwab, Alpha Vantage, Nasdaq API) and is not an
   authorized issuer feed.

2. **`marketPrice` is a QQQ proxy, not a real HQQQ traded price.**
   HQQQ is synthetic / educational and does not trade on an
   exchange. Premium/discount is computed versus live QQQ as a
   reference.

3. **Phase 2 is not an HA platform.** The replica-smoke verifies
   gateway-replica correctness, not full high-availability. Stateful
   infra (Kafka / Redis / Timescale) and non-gateway workers are
   single-instance in the demo environment. This is scheduled to be resolved in future Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 (under construction)

Phase 3 focuses on Kubernetes operationalization of the **app tier**:
run gateway, ingress, and workers on Kubernetes (`Deployment` + `Service`),
add HPA for gateway elasticity (CPU and/or custom metrics), and manage
runtime config via `ConfigMap` and secrets via `Secret`. Stateful infra
(`Kafka` / `Redis` / `Postgres`) remains independent or managed where
appropriate. Operating principle: stateless app tier on Kubernetes for
operability and elasticity; stateful infra treated as separate reliability
concerns.
